Changes in RAGEs

Gilliam - All 3 present and correct.

Karp:
Initially I had a positive here, however after discussions with Saire we changed the classification of an integrase to truncated. This means karp_73 is no longer recognized as a complete RAGE (not that it was by you guys previously, though you do call the integrase complete)
s
kato:
- kato_59 no longer classified as a RAGE as it doesn't contain full length traD (but does contain a full length traDti)
- kato_02 previously identified by me as a RAGE based on extreme similarity to a different full length integrase. However we since reclassified the integrase as truncated and so this RAGE is no longer recognized.

ut76:
RAGE_ut76_10 is now identified as a complete RAGE. All genes required are present and complete, discussions with Saire, Jeanne and Mike verified changes in annotation.

All other genomes remain unchanged and complete RAGE free.
