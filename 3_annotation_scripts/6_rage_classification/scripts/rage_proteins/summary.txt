Lists tested thoroughly;

1. exclusion_list
2. lists_combined

These were refined with lots of bed file testing on different genomes (karp, gilliam, boryong and maybe ikeda (but i don't think this actually was done))


Tra proteins:

These are the conjugal proteins that have to be present in a RAGE region



transposases:

This is a short list of transposases (including transposase), one has to be present in the RAGE


Cargo proteins:

NEED TO: develop this list from the paper and the list_combined


Boundaries:

This file is for defining the boundaries of complete rages. integrase is entered twice as a complete RAGE can either be bordered by 2 or these, or one of these and a dnaA.

May want to permit domain containing protein type things in this region.
