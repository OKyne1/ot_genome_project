Genome summary stats

Percentage genome RAGE
1. calculate the area in bed file
2. calculate the length of the fasta file/length from gbff
3. 1/2*100

Percentage open reading frames RAGE
1. Convert gbff to txt
2. Count the number of lines (total)
3. Count the number of lines in bed file regions
4. 2/3*100

Number of RAGE derived blocks
wc -l rage_derived_regions.bed

Number of IR regions
1. wc -l rage_derived_regions.bed
2. +1 if 1st value in bed file is >1
3. +1 if last value in bed < length fasta (or length -1)

Number of complete RAGEs
wc -l complete_RAGE.bed

3. tRNAs



Need to reconsider this for contigs!
