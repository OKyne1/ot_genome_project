Desired info:
1. Number of RAGE genes (Based on the bed file and gbff)
2. Percentage of ORFs in RAGEs (need to use the gbff file here and then fishout info for different regions - careful on the boundaries issue)
3. Number of RAGE blocks (wc -l bedfile.bed)
4. Number of IR regions (this is the inverse, but not sure what needs to be done around the ends here - may need to define the length of contigs)
5. Number of complete RAGEs (wc -l complete_rage.bed)
