# Annotation of RAGE regions
Structure:
1. Defining RAGE derived regions
2. Defining boundaries for complete RAGEs
3. Validating boundaries within RAGE derived regions
4. Identifying complete RAGEs based on required genes

## RAGE derived regions

## Complete RAGE boundaries
Rules for boundaries are:

## Validating boundaries

## Testing for required genes
