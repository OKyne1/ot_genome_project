The aim of this section is to determine where to add in domain   qbased information (product description or note):

Method:
1. Extract all gene descriptions for locus tags recognised as being anks
2. 

Results:
Ank proteins are identified correctly by bakta, and generatlly have a number of ank repeats labelled in the product (in boryong and karp, may need to check others). In both boryong and karp it is quite reasonable to replace the product description with whatever I determine from the hmmer search.   


Questions:
1. Is it worth validating the ank recognition/that the same number of anks are recognised by my method as in the paper? I don't think is as my method is standardised and very valid. However, we should carefully consider the threshold.
