Command line usage:

python ../scripts/1_cog_removal.py *.gbff


Outputs:

modified_*.gbff


Actions:

Removes the /gene= entries for genes with db_xref entries matching the COG value given


Limitations:

This has not been tested to check if it results in excessive gene name removal, the assumption is it doesn't. However, investigations showed it removed 134/1742 gene names entries (real values should be ~67/871) from boryong, I think this is a very reasonable amount, especially when the product takes primacy and this is typically correct.
