# copper(i)-binding protein # this is a new annotation and replaces a hypothetical protein in a ihp region. may not belong in this list.
znf/thioredoxin-put domain-containing protein
# znf/thioredoxin-put domain-containing protein # replaces the zinc_ribbon_4 in karp
conjugative transfer domain protein
# rna-binding protein # this is pretty unspecific and can belong to ir or rage
multidrug resistance protein mdtl
mdtl
# mfs transporter # almost always found in ir so not included
# putative permease # replaces a transposase but most nearly all permeases are found in ir regions
flih
# flih probably shouldn't be annotated, i'm pretty sure this is an issue arrising from cog. replaces a transposase
ssb
single-stranded dna-binding protein
# peptidase replaced a hypothetical protein # not included as too many other hits
