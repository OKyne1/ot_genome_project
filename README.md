# ot_genome_project

This is the repo for code relating to assembly and annotation of O. tsutsugamushi genomes. 

## Sections
- Assembly
- Annotation
- Analysis

## Assembly
This section contains;
1. *O. tsutsugamushi* optimised assembly scripts
2. Assembly quality control steps
3. Other, a collection of extract things that are useful, but not essential to the assembly pipeline (or were used in optimisation)

## Annotation
The annotation approach used for *O. tsutsugamushi* uses Bakta with user provided genes. The user provided genes are comprised of; heavily cleaned names from the Giengkam 2023 paper and additional annotations from NCBI for certain genes which annotated poorly and have low sequence homology between different copies of the gene.
