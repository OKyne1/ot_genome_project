I have given brief descriptions of how to generate the plots at the top of the R scripts. Read this. You can also check the scripts used to generate the plots (you will want to change the working directory) found in the folder I gave to Jeanne on dropbox.

Note for pairwise comparisons, if complete RAGEs are also visualized, empty bed files (i.e. ones without rages) will result in errors and so shouldn't be included.
