# Pipeline for Assembly of Highly Repetitive Intracellular Bacteria Using Nanopore Reads
## Initial Optimisation Tests
### Different Assemblers
Canu and flye were both tested. In this analysis flye performed significantly better and required ~60x fewer CPU hours. Consequently, in the future all assemblies will be performed using flye.

### Flye Assembly Optimisation
#### Testing --min-overlap Parameter


## 1. Read filtering

## 2. Pre-assembly filtering and flye assembly

## 3. Medaka polishing with ONT reads

## 4. Illumina polishing (Optional)
