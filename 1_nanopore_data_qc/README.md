### Run Report

Things to check:
1. Amount of data generated
2. Software versions
3. Basecalling settings
4. Q score over time
5. Pore activity
6. Translocation speed

#### Amount of data generated

#### Software version

#### Basecalling settings
Multiple tests showed Super-accurate basecalling (AKA super high accuracy). This can result in lower amounts of data being classified but accuracy base calling. As read accuracy is crucial to assembly of RAGEs we deamed this an important parameter to use.
