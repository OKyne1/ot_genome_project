# QUAST

QUAST (Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies) can be used to evaluate the quality of genome assemblies without a reference by analyzing metrics such as contig and scaffold N50, genome size, and GC content.

Probably the most useful thing it produces it the plot of contig Nx as it shows how contigs are distributed.

Usage:
`quast *.fasta`

Ensure that the environment you run this from contains quast.
